    <h2>Classic</h2>
     <p>
        A classic is an outstanding example of a particular style; 
        something of lasting worth or with a timeless quality; of the first or highest quality, class, or rank[1]
        something that exemplifies its class. The word can be an adjective (a classic car) or a noun 
        (a classic of English literature). It denotes a particular quality in art, architecture, literature, design, technology, or 
        other cultural artifacts. In commerce, products are named 'classic' to denote a long-standing popular version or model, 
        to distinguish it from a newer variety. Classic is used to describe many major, long-standing sporting events. Colloquially, 
        an everyday occurrence (e.g. a joke or mishap) may be described in some dialects of English as 'an absolute classic'.
